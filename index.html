                        <p>Today, for the first time, I had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza"><strong>pizza</strong></a> for breakfast... real pizza. I couldn't believe it either! It was perhaps the best food I have ever eaten in this decade and on this planet. It was so <em>out of this world</em>, even words can't describe how bomb this pizza was!</p>
                        <p>Where do I even begin? It's like in a flat, round shape, and it had this outer rim that was slightly elevated. I'm guessing it's to prevent the contents of the pizza from falling off. And before the pizza was served to me, it was sliced into triangles! Yes, triangles! How is that even possible, turning a circle into triangles?</p>
                        <p>I'll be pondering about the crazy phenomena of pizzas for the next few weeks... and eating them. <em>Nom</em>.</p>

                        <p>I begin where? A flat, round shape is what it's in like, and this slightly elevated outer rim is what it had.
